Nowdays lots of ppl take online courses, instead of ordinary classes. Both physical and online education have their pros and cons, so it's really up to the person's liking. I think online classes are really useful, because they offer lots of oppurtunities for students. With online courses students can attend classes even from outside the country, which makes it significantly more flexible and easy. Recently online courses started getting more and more popular, especially with the outburst of COVID-19, and bc of this, universities are starting to enroll more online classes, which results in a wider range of courses to choose from. Many ppl believe that only physical education is suitable for learning, but I think online courses can be just as effective, or even better if they are done well. For example it's pretty hard to be late to class if all you have to do is take a laptop out and join the class. Even though online courses have lots of benefits over ordinary phisycal education, it's a fact that sometimes it has some downsides to it, for example technology doesn't always work as it should and it can make online classes significantly harder or straight up impossible
