Hi Beth, today I heard that u finally recovered from ur sickness, I'm very sorry for u, and that u had such a tough time recently.
I'm hoping that getting back to school won't be that hard for u. I think ur school does a very bad job of supporting their students,
they could help u a lot more with letting u have only a few classes a day, or just helping u catch up with the rest of the class.
Don't be sad about ur friends doing things without u, cause u will have a lot of programmes and adventures with them in the future.
Try not to overstress urself in the upcoming time, take things step by step, just pace urself a bit. if u ever get stuck on smth,
or it's too hard for u don't be afraid to ask for help. I hope ur teachers and friends will help u with all they could, maybe u could
ask ur teacher to let u skip some of the homework, so u can have more time to catch up on the actual course material.
Get better soon and try to catch up both with schoolwork and ur social life, like activities with ur friends.
Short fucking sentence innit.
